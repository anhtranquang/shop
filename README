To deploy your Java Spring Boot project to AWS using this Dockerfile, you can follow these steps:
Build the project by running the following command in the root directory of your project:
    ./mvnw package
This will build the project and generate a jar file in the target directory.

Build the Docker image by running the following command in the same directory as the Dockerfile:
    docker build -t myapp .

This will build a Docker image with the tag "myapp" using the Dockerfile in the current directory.
Tag the Docker image with the AWS repository URL. The repository URL should be in the format <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>.
    docker tag myapp <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:latest

Push the Docker image to the AWS repository.
    docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:latest
Deploy the Docker image to a container using Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, or any other container orchestration service on AWS.
Here is an example ECS task definition that you can use:
json
    {
      "family": "shop",
      "containerDefinitions": [
        {
          "name": "shop",
          "image": "<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<aws_region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:latest",
          "portMappings": [
            {
              "containerPort": 8080,
              "protocol": "tcp"
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "requiresCompatibilities": [
        "EC2"
      ],
      "networkMode": "bridge",
      "cpu": "256",
      "memory": "512",
      "executionRoleArn": "ecsTaskExecutionRole",
      "taskRoleArn": "ecsTaskExecutionRole"
    }
This task definition specifies a container named "shop" that runs the Docker image in the AWS repository,
listens on port 8080, and has 256 CPU units and 512 MiB of memory. You can customize the task definition to suit your needs.
